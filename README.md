The game Genius Square involves a 6x6 grid, and 9 tetris-like pieces. 7 dice are rolled, in order to select 7 squares on the grid to be 
blocked out with pegs. Then the player needs to place the 9 pieces into the grid to fill it up.

This program allows you to input the coordinates of the 7 blocked out squares, solves the game and draws the solution.
